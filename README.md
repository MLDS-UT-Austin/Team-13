Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA):

wOBA is a comprehensive measure of offensive production that assigns weights to different types of offensive events based on their run-scoring value.
It considers factors such as singles, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, and hit-by-pitches.
Higher weights are assigned to events with a greater impact on scoring runs (e.g., home runs), while lower weights are assigned to events with less impact (e.g., singles).

Isolated Power (ISO):

ISO measures a player's raw power by quantifying the difference between their slugging percentage and batting average.
It provides insights into a player's ability to generate extra-base hits, excluding the contribution from singles.
Higher ISO values indicate a greater ability to hit for power and extra-base hits.

Adjusted Batting Average (Adj. BA):

Adj. BA adjusts a player's batting average to account for factors such as ballpark effects, league-wide batting averages, and pitching quality.
It provides a more accurate assessment of a player's batting performance by accounting for external factors that may influence batting averages.

Batting Runs Above Average (BsRAA):

BsRAA quantifies a player's batting performance relative to league average, taking into account the run-scoring environment and the player's offensive contributions.
It provides a measure of how many runs a player contributes with their batting performance compared to an average player in the league.

Deserved Runs Created Plus (dRC+):

dRC+ is a comprehensive metric that combines a player's ability to create runs (based on total bases, walks, and steals) with adjustments for league and park effects.
It provides a normalized measure of a player's offensive production, with 100 representing league average and values above or below indicating performance above or below average, respectively.

Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP):

BABIP measures a player's batting average on balls put in play, excluding home runs and strikeouts.
It provides insights into a player's ability to generate hits on balls in play, adjusting for factors such as defense, luck, and batted ball profile.

Run Expectancy (RE):

RE quantifies the expected number of runs a player contributes with each plate appearance, based on the specific game situation (e.g., base-out states, inning, score).
It provides insights into a player's ability to generate runs in different game contexts, accounting for situational factors that may impact offensive production.
